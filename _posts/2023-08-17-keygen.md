# ssh-keygen automation

For ages I've wondered how to run ssh-keygen on a machine without user input, I've wanted to do this when deploying new machines in some kind of a CI/CD pipeline where I can't answer ssh-keygens command line questions, it's so simple!

```bash
yes y | ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f /tmp/keys
```
