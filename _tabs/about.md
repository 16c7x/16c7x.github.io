## You might be wondering, "whats with the 16c7x thing?".

It's from my final year college project which lead on to my very first job.
I managed to convince [Jordan Grand Prix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Grand_Prix) to give me (and fund) my final year college project. They needed a test box to check the functionality of the electronics in their steering wheels. They were already using the [PIC16C73](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/ProductCompare/PIC16C73/PIC16F74) and [PIC16C74](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/ProductCompare/PIC16C73/PIC16F74), an SMT version was already in the steering wheel providing the digital display and in the dashboard driving the shift lights. So, my final year project was to build a test box around a [PIC16C73](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/ProductCompare/PIC16C73/PIC16F74) and write Assembly code around it's [instruction set](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/31029a.pdf) to test all the steering wheel functions. It worked well enough that they gave me job as an electronics engineer.
